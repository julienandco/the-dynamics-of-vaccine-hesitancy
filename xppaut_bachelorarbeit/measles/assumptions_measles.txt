Assumptions made for the first model regarding measles in Germany

s(0) = 0.9
i(0) = 0.1
x(0) = 0

(I varied s,i and x quite merrily and what was almost the same: i -> 0, x stays approx x_start and s -> 1-x)

a: 0.995 (has to be as high as recovery rate, since everybody gets measles max. once in a lifetime (esp. if you're recovered, you're immune))
b: 1.57 (birthrate in germany in 2017) (or should i put 0.78, since it is 1.57 children per female, but there are only 50% females in german population?)
alpha: 0.995(recovery rate in germany (educated guess from who, rki and wikipedia websites))
beta: 0.9 (laut RKI: secondary attack rate von masern > 0.9)
mu : 0.0125 (death rate in germany in 2019)
theta_X: 0.16 (arbitrary)
theta_Y: 0.09 (arbitrary)
n_X: 0.55 (assumption made since there is a measles vax law now and to pass it had to have more than 50% of the votes)
n_Y: 0.05 (paper from BA: 5% in germany are anti-vaxxers)

Omega = b (since I am pretty sure that we introduced two parameters that basically stand for the same. to be discussed :D)


--> stable point:

s=0.84575
i=almost 0
r = 0.15425

--> does this make sense? Not to me...
