\begin{model}[My model V1]
Consider a population of size $N \in \mathbb{N}$, where $X_t \in \lbrace 0,\dots,N\rbrace$ and $N-X_t$ describe the amount of vaccinators and anti-vaccinators at time $t$, respectively. Furthermore, let $N_X$ and $N_Y > 0$ be the number of zealots that support vaccination and refuse it, respectively. Let $\alpha,\beta \in \left[0,1\right]$ and $a,b, \Omega \in \mathbb{N}$ ($\alpha$ = recovery rate, $\beta$ = infection rate, $a$ = scaling factor for disease prevalence, $b$ = birth rate of pop., $\Omega$ scaling factor for anti-vaxx influence). An individual of the population (who is not a zealot) may reconsider his opinion with rate $\mu \in \mathbb{N}$ via the same process as described in the Zealot model and in addition of the contact rates $\theta_X, \theta_Y \in \left[0,1\right]$. Let $S \in \lbrace 0,\dots,N\rbrace$ and $I \in  \lbrace 0,\dots,N\rbrace$ describe the amount of susceptibles and infecteds. Now, rescale $S,I$ and $X_t$ via deterministic limit and assume $N_X$ and $N_Y$ to scale linearly with the population size $N$: $n_X,Y = \frac{N_X,Y}{N}$. Then, the model reads as follows:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
			\dot{s} &= -\beta si + b\left(1-x\right) - bs\\
			\dot{i} &= \beta si - i\left(\alpha + b\right)\\
			\dot{x} &= -\mu x\frac{\theta_Y(1-x+n_Y+\Omega)}{(x+n_X+ai) + \theta_Y(1-x+n_Y+\Omega)}\\
			&\qquad+ \mu \left(1-x\right)\frac{\theta_X (x+ n_X+ ai)}{\theta_X (x + n_X + ai) + (1-x + n_Y + \Omega)}
		\end{split}
	\end{align}
\end{model}
