 abstract = {Immunization programs have often been impeded by vaccine scares, as evidenced by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) autism vaccine scare in Britain. A {\textquotedbl}free rider{\textquotedbl} effect may be partly responsible: vaccine-generated herd immunity can reduce disease incidence to such low levels that real or imagined vaccine risks appear large in comparison, causing individuals to cease vaccinating. This implies a feedback loop between disease prevalence and strategic individual vaccinating behavior. Here, we analyze a model based on evolutionary game theory that captures this feedback in the context of vaccine scares, and that also includes social learning. Vaccine risk perception evolves over time according to an exogenously imposed curve. We test the model against vaccine coverage data and disease incidence data from two vaccine scares in England {\&} Wales: the whole cell pertussis vaccine scare and the MMR vaccine scare. The model fits vaccine coverage data from both vaccine scares relatively well. Moreover, the model can explain the vaccine coverage data more parsimoniously than most competing models without social learning and/or feedback (hence, adding social learning and feedback to a vaccine scare model improves model fit with little or no parsimony penalty). Under some circumstances, the model can predict future vaccine coverage and disease incidence--up to 10 years in advance in the case of pertussis--including specific qualitative features of the dynamics, such as future incidence peaks and undulations in vaccine coverage due to the population's response to changing disease incidence. Vaccine scares could become more common as eradication goals are approached for more vaccine-preventable diseases. Such models could help us predict how vaccine scares might unfold and assist mitigation efforts.},

@article{Bednarz2020,
 abstract = {Relevance Although the seasonal flu vaccine remains the most effective way to prevent the spread of influenza and reduce its associated mortalities, the proportion of individuals receiving the vaccine continues to be an issue in various communities across the United States. The attitudes of residents who live in Sneedville, a small town in a rural northeastern Tennessee, were surveyed. Objective(s) To determine the barriers to influenza vaccination in Sneedville, Tennessee and contribute to the literature on why some rural communities across the United States show low influenza vaccination rates. Materials and Methods Door-to-door convenience sampling was conducted in Sneedville, TN. Participants were asked to complete a survey consisting of --three yes or no demographic questions (one with an option to further elaborate) and nine opinion questions based on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). Participants were not provided any additional details pertaining to the Likert scale questions and were given the option to skip the Likert scale questions. These questions were chosen to gauge the potential structural, socioeconomic, belief, and provider-related barriers to vaccination. Two-tailed independent t-tests were used to compare the Likert scale means for each of the nine opinion questions in those that received the influenza vaccine and those who did not. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess difference in the distribution of Likert responses in vaccinators compared to non-vaccinators. Results This project surveyed 172 residents of which 60.5{\%} (104/172) indicated that they did not receive the influenza vaccine for the 2017-2018 flu season. Compared to individuals who vaccinate against the flu, individuals who do not vaccinate against the flu believe the flu shot is not worthwhile and believe the flu shot has a greater chance to make them sick.~ Conclusions This study finds that structural, socioeconomic, and provider-related barriers are not the underlying cause of the low influenza vaccination rates in this rural area. Instead, public opinion on influenza vaccination seems to be the reason for the disparity.},

@misc{Chitra2019,
 abstract = {Recent studies suggest that social media usage -- while linked to an increased diversity of information and perspectives for users -- has exacerbated user polarization on many issues. A popular theory for this phenomenon centers on the concept of {\textquotedbl}filter bubbles{\textquotedbl}: by automatically recommending content that a user is likely to agree with, social network algorithms create echo chambers of similarly-minded users that would not have arisen otherwise. However, while echo chambers have been observed in real-world networks, the evidence for filter bubbles is largely post-hoc.  In this work, we develop a mathematical framework to study the filter bubble theory. We modify the classic Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model by introducing another actor, the network administrator, who filters content for users by making small changes to the edge weights of a social network (for example, adjusting a news feed algorithm to change the level of interaction between users).  On real-world networks from Reddit and Twitter, we show that when the network administrator is incentivized to reduce disagreement among users, even relatively small edge changes can result in the formation of echo chambers in the network and increase user polarization. We theoretically support this observed sensitivity of social networks to outside intervention by analyzing synthetic graphs generated from the stochastic block model. Finally, we show that a slight modification to the incentives of the network administrator can mitigate the filter bubble effect while minimally affecting the administrator's target objective, user disagreement.},

@article{MacDonald2015,
 abstract = {The SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy concluded that vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccines. It is influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence. The Working Group retained the term 'vaccine' rather than 'vaccination' hesitancy, although the latter more correctly implies the broader range of immunization concerns, as vaccine hesitancy is the more commonly used term. While high levels of hesitancy lead to low vaccine demand, low levels of hesitancy do not necessarily mean high vaccine demand. The Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix displays the factors influencing the behavioral decision to accept, delay or reject some or all vaccines under three categories: contextual, individual and group, and vaccine/vaccination-specific influences.},
