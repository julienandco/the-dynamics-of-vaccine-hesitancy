 abstract = {Immunization programs have often been impeded by vaccine scares, as evidenced by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) autism vaccine scare in Britain. A {\textquotedbl}free rider{\textquotedbl} effect may be partly responsible: vaccine-generated herd immunity can reduce disease incidence to such low levels that real or imagined vaccine risks appear large in comparison, causing individuals to cease vaccinating. This implies a feedback loop between disease prevalence and strategic individual vaccinating behavior. Here, we analyze a model based on evolutionary game theory that captures this feedback in the context of vaccine scares, and that also includes social learning. Vaccine risk perception evolves over time according to an exogenously imposed curve. We test the model against vaccine coverage data and disease incidence data from two vaccine scares in England {\&} Wales: the whole cell pertussis vaccine scare and the MMR vaccine scare. The model fits vaccine coverage data from both vaccine scares relatively well. Moreover, the model can explain the vaccine coverage data more parsimoniously than most competing models without social learning and/or feedback (hence, adding social learning and feedback to a vaccine scare model improves model fit with little or no parsimony penalty). Under some circumstances, the model can predict future vaccine coverage and disease incidence--up to 10 years in advance in the case of pertussis--including specific qualitative features of the dynamics, such as future incidence peaks and undulations in vaccine coverage due to the population's response to changing disease incidence. Vaccine scares could become more common as eradication goals are approached for more vaccine-preventable diseases. Such models could help us predict how vaccine scares might unfold and assist mitigation efforts.},

@misc{Chitra2019,
 abstract = {Recent studies suggest that social media usage -- while linked to an increased diversity of information and perspectives for users -- has exacerbated user polarization on many issues. A popular theory for this phenomenon centers on the concept of {\textquotedbl}filter bubbles{\textquotedbl}: by automatically recommending content that a user is likely to agree with, social network algorithms create echo chambers of similarly-minded users that would not have arisen otherwise. However, while echo chambers have been observed in real-world networks, the evidence for filter bubbles is largely post-hoc.  In this work, we develop a mathematical framework to study the filter bubble theory. We modify the classic Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model by introducing another actor, the network administrator, who filters content for users by making small changes to the edge weights of a social network (for example, adjusting a news feed algorithm to change the level of interaction between users).  On real-world networks from Reddit and Twitter, we show that when the network administrator is incentivized to reduce disagreement among users, even relatively small edge changes can result in the formation of echo chambers in the network and increase user polarization. We theoretically support this observed sensitivity of social networks to outside intervention by analyzing synthetic graphs generated from the stochastic block model. Finally, we show that a slight modification to the incentives of the network administrator can mitigate the filter bubble effect while minimally affecting the administrator's target objective, user disagreement.},
