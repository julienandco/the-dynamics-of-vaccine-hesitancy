@article{Aguiar2011,
 abstract = {In population genetics, the Moran model describes the neutral evolution of a biallelic gene in a population of haploid individuals subjected to mutations. We show in this paper that this model can be mapped into an influence dynamical process on networks subjected to external influences. The panmictic case considered by Moran corresponds to fully connected networks and can be completely solved in terms of hypergeometric functions. Other types of networks correspond to structured populations, for which approximate solutions are also available. This approach to the classic Moran model leads to a relation between regular networks based on spatial grids and the mechanism of isolation by distance. We discuss the consequences of this connection for topopatric speciation and the theory of neutral speciation and biodiversity. We show that the effect of mutations in structured populations, where individuals can mate only with neighbors, is greatly enhanced with respect to the panmictic case. If mating is further constrained by genetic proximity between individuals, a balance of opposing tendencies takes place: increasing diversity promoted by enhanced effective mutations versus decreasing diversity promoted by similarity between mates. Resolution of large enough opposing tendencies occurs through speciation via pattern formation. We derive an explicit expression that indicates when speciation is possible involving the parameters characterizing the population. We also show that the time to speciation is greatly reduced in comparison with the panmictic case.},

@article{Bauch2012,
 abstract = {Immunization programs have often been impeded by vaccine scares, as evidenced by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) autism vaccine scare in Britain. A {\textquotedbl}free rider{\textquotedbl} effect may be partly responsible: vaccine-generated herd immunity can reduce disease incidence to such low levels that real or imagined vaccine risks appear large in comparison, causing individuals to cease vaccinating. This implies a feedback loop between disease prevalence and strategic individual vaccinating behavior. Here, we analyze a model based on evolutionary game theory that captures this feedback in the context of vaccine scares, and that also includes social learning. Vaccine risk perception evolves over time according to an exogenously imposed curve. We test the model against vaccine coverage data and disease incidence data from two vaccine scares in England {\&} Wales: the whole cell pertussis vaccine scare and the MMR vaccine scare. The model fits vaccine coverage data from both vaccine scares relatively well. Moreover, the model can explain the vaccine coverage data more parsimoniously than most competing models without social learning and/or feedback (hence, adding social learning and feedback to a vaccine scare model improves model fit with little or no parsimony penalty). Under some circumstances, the model can predict future vaccine coverage and disease incidence--up to 10 years in advance in the case of pertussis--including specific qualitative features of the dynamics, such as future incidence peaks and undulations in vaccine coverage due to the population's response to changing disease incidence. Vaccine scares could become more common as eradication goals are approached for more vaccine-preventable diseases. Such models could help us predict how vaccine scares might unfold and assist mitigation efforts.},

@article{Bednarz2020,
 abstract = {Relevance Although the seasonal flu vaccine remains the most effective way to prevent the spread of influenza and reduce its associated mortalities, the proportion of individuals receiving the vaccine continues to be an issue in various communities across the United States. The attitudes of residents who live in Sneedville, a small town in a rural northeastern Tennessee, were surveyed. Objective(s) To determine the barriers to influenza vaccination in Sneedville, Tennessee and contribute to the literature on why some rural communities across the United States show low influenza vaccination rates. Materials and Methods Door-to-door convenience sampling was conducted in Sneedville, TN. Participants were asked to complete a survey consisting of --three yes or no demographic questions (one with an option to further elaborate) and nine opinion questions based on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). Participants were not provided any additional details pertaining to the Likert scale questions and were given the option to skip the Likert scale questions. These questions were chosen to gauge the potential structural, socioeconomic, belief, and provider-related barriers to vaccination. Two-tailed independent t-tests were used to compare the Likert scale means for each of the nine opinion questions in those that received the influenza vaccine and those who did not. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess difference in the distribution of Likert responses in vaccinators compared to non-vaccinators. Results This project surveyed 172 residents of which 60.5{\%} (104/172) indicated that they did not receive the influenza vaccine for the 2017-2018 flu season. Compared to individuals who vaccinate against the flu, individuals who do not vaccinate against the flu believe the flu shot is not worthwhile and believe the flu shot has a greater chance to make them sick.~ Conclusions This study finds that structural, socioeconomic, and provider-related barriers are not the underlying cause of the low influenza vaccination rates in this rural area. Instead, public opinion on influenza vaccination seems to be the reason for the disparity.},

@article{Braha2017,
 abstract = {Social influence plays an important role in human behavior and decisions. Sources of influence can be divided as external, which are independent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and friends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by peers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and observational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the extent of contagion based on large-scale observational data with an unknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap between the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human dynamics and the detailed approach of social sciences, we present a parsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in political science-elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical expression of the county vote-share distribution, which is in excellent agreement with almost a century of observed U.S. presidential election data. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an abrupt phase transition from low to high levels of social contagion, and robust differences among regions. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more instrumental in shaping large-scale collective political behavior, with implications on democratic electoral processes and policies.},

@misc{Chitra2019,
 abstract = {Recent studies suggest that social media usage -- while linked to an increased diversity of information and perspectives for users -- has exacerbated user polarization on many issues. A popular theory for this phenomenon centers on the concept of {\textquotedbl}filter bubbles{\textquotedbl}: by automatically recommending content that a user is likely to agree with, social network algorithms create echo chambers of similarly-minded users that would not have arisen otherwise. However, while echo chambers have been observed in real-world networks, the evidence for filter bubbles is largely post-hoc.  In this work, we develop a mathematical framework to study the filter bubble theory. We modify the classic Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model by introducing another actor, the network administrator, who filters content for users by making small changes to the edge weights of a social network (for example, adjusting a news feed algorithm to change the level of interaction between users).  On real-world networks from Reddit and Twitter, we show that when the network administrator is incentivized to reduce disagreement among users, even relatively small edge changes can result in the formation of echo chambers in the network and increase user polarization. We theoretically support this observed sensitivity of social networks to outside intervention by analyzing synthetic graphs generated from the stochastic block model. Finally, we show that a slight modification to the incentives of the network administrator can mitigate the filter bubble effect while minimally affecting the administrator's target objective, user disagreement.},

@article{Dandekar2013,
 abstract = {We study the issue of polarization in society through a model of opinion formation. We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content.},

To determine the likelihood of finding an antivaccination site on the world wide web and to characterise their explicit claims and rhetorical appeals.

METHODS

Using {\textquotedbl}vaccination{\textquotedbl} and {\textquotedbl}immunisation{\textquotedbl}, examining the first 10 sites displayed on seven leading search engines. Detailed examination of content of 100 antivaccination sites found on Google.

RESULTS

43{\%} of websites were antivaccination (all of the first 10 on Google). Main rhetorical appeals involve themes of the scientific veracity of antivaccination argument; rapport with parents seeking to protect their children from harm; and alleged collusion between doctors, the pharmaceutical industry, and government to deny vaccine harm.

CONCLUSIONS

There is a high probability that parents will encounter elaborate antivaccination material on the world wide web. Factual refutational strategies alone are unlikely to counter the highly rhetorical appeals that shape these sites.},

 abstract = {Vaccines have saved millions of lives and reduced the severity of many infections. A reduction in vaccination coverage is now reflected in the re-emergence of epidemics of mumps, pertussis, measles and chickenpox. Many people do not recognize the effectiveness of vaccination and fear the side effects. The main concern is the safety of vaccines. Lack of information weighs less than lack of trust in health authorities. The greater responsibility of the individual and the respect for his free will, may lead the authorities to a less vigourous promotion of the {\textquotedbl}vaccination duty{\textquotedbl} which is also a social duty. The attitude of individuals is guided by their health beliefs which are often supported by an erroneous perception of risk. In addition, insidious anti-vaccine lobbying plays on fears and uses biased reasoning that the media help to amplify. Thus the analysis of the brakes to vaccination both in the general population and among health professionals, the dismantling of the arguments developed by the anti-vaccine leagues and vigilance with regard to {\textquotedbl}fake news{\textquotedbl} should allow a concerted communication, transparent, clear and effective, in order to limit the occurrence of preventable deaths.},

Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccines. It is influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence. The Working Group retained the term 'vaccine' rather than 'vaccination' hesitancy, although the latter more correctly implies the broader range of immunization concerns, as vaccine hesitancy is the more commonly used term. While high levels of hesitancy lead to low vaccine demand, low levels of hesitancy do not necessarily mean high vaccine demand.

In Germany the anti-vaccine movement is rather small (3-5{\%} of the population). Nevertheless its influence on the acceptance of immunisation by the population may be substantial, as shown by the examples of smallpox vaccination and the recent discussion of the combined MMR vaccine in the UK. Modern societies facilitate networking and the dissemination of anti-vaccination ideas. The decline in the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases has led to a reduced awareness of possible complications from infectious diseases and to an overestimation of the incidence of rarely occurring adverse events following immunisation.

An alternative strategy at the camp consisted of dispersal of exposed persons from the camp and their being quarantined in their home States. Three deaths (case-fatality ratio = 2.2 percent) were reported at the college; no serious complications were reported from the camp-associated epidemic. No transmission into the general community occurred in either epidemic. Public health officials are encouraged to be aware of the legal rights and obligations of religiously exempt groups so that outbreaks in these groups can be effectively controlled, even if standard immunization strategies are not possible.

Instead of giving you the most broadly popular result, Google now tries to predict what you are most likely to click on.

Though the phenomenon has gone largely undetected until now, personalized filters are sweeping the Web, creating individual universes of information for each of us. Data companies track your personal information to sell to advertisers, from your political leanings to the hiking boots you just browsed on Zappos. In a personalized world, we will increasingly be typed and fed only news that is pleasant, familiar, and confirms our beliefs--and because these filters are invisible, we won't know what is being hidden from us.

@misc{Vicario2016,
 abstract = {Online users tend to select claims that adhere to their system of beliefs and to ignore dissenting information. Confirmation bias, indeed, plays a pivotal role in viral phenomena. Furthermore, the wide availability of content on the web fosters the aggregation of likeminded people where debates tend to enforce group polarization. Such a configuration might alter the public debate and thus the formation of the public opinion. In this paper we provide a mathematical model to study online social debates and the related polarization dynamics. We assume the basic updating rule of the Bounded Confidence Model (BCM) and we develop two variations a) the Rewire with Bounded Confidence Model (RBCM), in which discordant links are broken until convergence is reached; and b) the Unbounded Confidence Model, under which the interaction among discordant pairs of users is allowed even with a negative feedback, either with the rewiring step (RUCM) or without it (UCM). From numerical simulations we find that the new models (UCM and RUCM), unlike the BCM, are able to explain the coexistence of two stable final opinions, often observed in reality. Lastly, we present a mean field approximation of the newly introduced models.},
