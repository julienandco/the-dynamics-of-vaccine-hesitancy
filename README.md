## Bachelor's thesis
# labeling style:

type:name_with_underscores, e.g. def:matrix_product, fig:what_ever
types: def,lem,thm,prop,fig,clm, eq, al(align), tbl

# figures:

Use inkscape or the tikz package for `all` of your images!

# referencing style:

For theorems, props, lemmas etc, just use Theorem \ref, so it gives you: Theorem 2.1, Lemma 4.2
For sections, undersections etc, just use Section \ref, so it gives you: Section 4.2, Subsection 4.4.3
For equations, whether they have a name or not (Campbell's Theorem), use \eqref w/o anything else, so it gives you: as in (12),
as in Campbell's Theorem (23)
For figures, use Figure \ref so it gives you Figure 1
If you have multiple figures in one, they have to be indexed `alphabetically`, e.g. 1a), 3d) etc.
For tables, use Table \ref so it gives you Table 2
